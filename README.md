# DELHI METRO RAIL APP

This is a straightforward Java program that asks the user for the name of the source and destination Delhi Metro stations, then displays the fare and the quickest metro route to get there. For easier navigation for commuters, it will also feature a metro map.

Data structures such as Heap and Graph are used to implement the concept. Edges and nodes make up the graph. A node represents a metro station, which will have information about the station such as its name, metro corridor, and connected lines. The distance between two stations is represented by edges, or the connection between two nodes, and the cost of each edge is equal to the distance between the two connecting stations (nodes) it connects.

The shortest path between the source station and the destination station is found using various methods, such as Dijkstra, breadth-first search, depth-first search, etc. The fare is then computed based on the total distance between the two stations. Lastly, the total fare and the metro route between the two stations are shown.

Main.java cointains all the major code and Heap.java contains heap implementation.


##  REQUIREMENTS

> The project can run on any online or offline Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, Netbeans, ideone.com, etc.
> You should have at least elementary knowledge of Java programming to work on the project.
> Knowledge of data structures like Graph and Heap and Algorithms like Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, etc is appreciated, however, it is not essential.
> And lastly, understanding the Collection framework makes it a cakewalk journey. (If you don't know about the Collection framework it is not a                   problem, you can proceed without it and while working if you feel the need to know you can refer to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collections-in-java-2/ ).


## That was all... You are all set to work on the project!!!!
